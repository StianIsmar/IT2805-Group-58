                Administrative Details
            </h3>
            <p>
                Antikvariatet is a cozy bar/pub/café/venue located at Bakklandet in Trondheim. It offers a great
                assortment of beers as well as outside serving. The inside of Antikvariatet consists of two separated
                areas. One offers a calm, laid-back atmosphere while
                the other hosts various kinds of events. The events ranges from small concerts and standup comedy to
                cultural performances and social debates.
            </p>
            <h3>
                Changes from P2
            </h3>
            <h4>
                Page layout and appearance
            </h4>
            <p>
                We decided to use font-family: -apple-system, BlinkMacSystemFont, 'Segoe UI', Roboto, Oxygen, Ubuntu,
                Cantarell, 'Open Sans', 'Helvetica Neue', sans-serif; instead of Times.
                <br>
                <br>
                Instead of having a margin on either side of the headings, we decided simply to center the title and use
                a 60px font size.
            </p>
            <h4>
                Fonts
            </h4>
            <p>
                The font size in the navbar was changed from 20px to 30px. The font size for the paragraphs, 16px, was
                kept as in P2.
            </p>
            <h4>Content changes
            </h4>
            <p>Here we will present the changes that were made to the files in the project from P2.</p>
            <br><br>
            <h5 class="h4-heading">Homepage.html
            </h5>
            <p>
                Our team decided to remove some of the pictures in Homepage.html. The image of the beer and chairs, from
                P2, were not visually pleasing enough. They gave the whole homepage a messy look.

                The image in the background in Homepage.html was changed from the design report. The reasoning behind
                this was that the new images makes it easier to read the text in the nav bar, as well as the log for
                ANTIKVARIATET.

                Restaurant.html
                We decided that image manipulation to prevent slow-loading is outside of the scope of the assignment.

                The image in Restaurant.html was swapped for a more gentle image of a cup of coffee. The colours in the
                image look better than the original image from the design report. The text on top of the image is easier
                to look at as well.
            </p>
            <h5 class="h4-heading">Event.html</h5>

            <p>
                The header on the page contains no buttons, as it was supposed to. Instead, the events are rendered as
                you enter the page, and you can choose to register to one if you click on the event to see more info.
                The event list is ordered by date, but it is not automatically filtered. We choose to manually code the
                dates so that it looks like the list is sorted. Since we did not specify filtering of the list in the
                requirements, we think this is a good solution for now, but it could be a possible future extension.

                In P2 design, we discussed having a calendar to show the events. This functionality was dropped.

                The background image was changed from the one in the P2 design. The new image makes it easier to read
                the text. The “Events” text was also changed to white from blue for easier reading.
            </p>

            <h5 class="h4-heading">Contact.html</h5>
            <p>We decided to specify the contact information in a separate page, in addition to the contact information
                in the footer. Looking back at P2, it was a bit unclear whether we were having a seperate contact us
                html.
            </p>

            <h5 class="h4-heading">Footer.js </h5>
            <p>The icons in the footer were form the FontAwesome API, and look a little different than the icons in P2.
                These social media icons have a white fill colour, which is easier to see than the darker icon colours
                in P2.

                The iframe map was in P2 a little more zoomed in upon page load. For the sake of the tourists in
                Trondheim, we decided to have the map a little more zoomed out.
            </p>

            <h5 class="h4-heading">Header.js</h5>
            <p>At a certain screen width, the navbar was originally supposed to collapse to a dropdown icon. We decided
                to omit this function. Instead it scales with respect to the screen width and becomes smaller to keep it
                responsive. To make it easier for the user to navigate and keep track of where they are, it was decided
                to add an underline under the current page link in navbar. The “Antikvariatet” logo linking to the
                homepage was included in navbar for simplicity.

                All the pictures from P2 were replaced to make the website look more intriguing and professional. The
                pictures for Homepage, Events and Contact were provided by Antikvariatet’s own facebook page to give the
                user a glimpse of Antikvariatet’s cozy atmosphere. The cafe image for Restaurant was chosen to be in
                compliance with page content.
            </p>

            <h5 class="h4-heading">Styling.css</h5>
            <p>We did not mention this in p2, but we wanted to implement the css-file as straightforward and clean as
                possible. We grouped the document by commenting for every page that we styled. </p>

            <h5 class="h4-heading">Changes in file structure</h5>
            <p>Originally, the footer and header were under one file called “modularity.js”. We decided to split the
                Footer.js and Header.js into two files, to make the file structure more clear. If someone wants to
                change the modularity elements at a later time, it is now easy to see which file contains the footer and
                header elements.

                The navbar was originally supposed to be a separate file as well. It was decided to include it in
                header.js since it is a natural part of the header.

                The register_to_event.js and search_funk.js files were merged to the file “search_func.js”, since they
                shared logic. Additionally, register_to_event.js contained very little code, so our team decided to
                place the files register_to_event.js and search_func.js in one file “search_func.js”
            </p>

            <h5 class="h4-heading">Other changes</h5>
            <p>We translated the norwegian texts to english to appeal to a broader audience.</p>

            <br><br>
            <h4>Minimum requirements (JS)</h4>
            <p>In this section we will present how the javascript requirements are fulfilled, and who completed them.</p>

            <h5 class="h4-heading">Footer.js</h5>
            <p>The requirement for modularity for the footer was handled in the footer.js file by Stian. We did this
                through Java Script by calling a certain empty element and filling it with the footer and header
                elements.
            </p>

            <h5 class="h4-heading">Header.js</h5>
            <p>The requirement for modularity for the header was handled in the header.js file by Morten. When entering
                one of the pages, a JavaScript function will load the header and navbar. They do no have the same header
                picture so the function checks which page it has entered and grabs the correct picture. It also
                underlines the correct page in navbar.

                We used media queries in css to make the header and navbar responsive. The images were of different
                sizes and some made it difficult to read the text when resizing the screen. When the screen width is
                below 550px the navbar and header size scales to fit smaller screens. The arrow button’s position is
                also updated. When the screen width is below 350px the arrow button’s position is updated once more.

                The “Restaurant” header picture did not resize nicely and needed special treatment. A JavaScript
                function that checks if it’s on the “Restaurant” page and if the screen width is smaller than 880px
                loads a differently cropped image deals with this.
            </p>

            <h5 class="h4-heading">Search_func.js</h5>
            <p>Kari Anne has implemented a JavaScript function that lets the user search for specific events on the
                Events page. A list of objects contains information about each event. When entering the page, all the
                event names are rendered. If you click on an event, a modal containing more information about the
                specific event will show. You can click on a button in the modal to register to the event. </p>

            <h5 class="h4-heading">Arrow_scroll.js</h5>
            <p>Ophelia implemented the javaScript function arrow_scroll. If the user clicks on the arrow which is used
                in both the homepage.html and restaurant.html, the page will scroll down to the content while the
                content fades in. The function uses the function scrollTo which takes in 0 as x value, and the current
                offset height of the header as y. This makes the window scroll down the height of the header so it
                “disappears”.</p>

            <h5 class="h4-heading">Appear_on_scroll.js</h5>
            <p>The appear_on_scroll javascript function was implemented by Ophelia. It uses eventlistener so that when
                the user scrolls the window the function “displayOnScroll” will fire. The function uses the scrollTop
                property which returns the number of pixels the window is scrolled vertically. If it returns a number
                higher then 50, it will change the classname of the context, and make it fade in smoothly. If the user
                already pushed the arrow button to make it appear, nothing will happen. The text is already faded in</p>
