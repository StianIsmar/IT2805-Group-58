                Antikvariatet is a cozy bar/pub/café/venue located at Bakklandet in Trondheim. It offers a great assortment of beers as well as outside serving. The inside of Antikvariatet consists of two separated areas. One offers a calm, laid-back atmosphere while
                the other hosts various kinds of events. The events ranges from small concerts and standup comedy to cultural performances and social debates.

            <h3>Testing Document</h3>
            <p>
                Instead of using a Google Form with questions, we decided to ask the test person a list of questions face to face. We decided to do this mainly because it takes less time and we were more 
                likely to get better responses, because we were able to ask follow-up questions etc.
            </p>
            <p>
                This idea was inspired by an article we found on <a id="link1" href="https://www.usertesting.com/blog/prototype-testing-questions/">usertesting.com.</a> 
            </p>
            <p>
                It states the following: 
                <i>“It’s also a good idea to <strong>run moderated tests</strong>  if you can. While you can conduct <strong>unmoderated</strong> tests with prototypes, chances are your participants will 
                    have questions and some tasks will require more explanation and guidance, so having a moderator present will help you get the best feedback.”</i>
            <br>
                <h4 >The Questions:</h4>
                <ol class="list">
                    <li>What do you think about the design?</li>
                    <li>How was navigating the web page?</li>
                    <li>What are you thoughts surrounding the content?</li>
                    <li>How was the usability? Was everything clear?</li>
                    <li>What were you missing from the website?</li>
                </ol>
            </p>
            <br>
            <p>
                    More importantly, as the user was testing the webpage, we were able to look over their shoulder to see how they maneuvered the page. This makes it easy to spot frustration and confusing 
                    design layout, just by looking at the where the test person clicks, as well as their facial expressions.
            </p>





            <h3>Tester Audience</h3>
            <p>
                    We wanted to focus on having quality over quantity for our testing, i. e. interviewing fewer participants but doing it more thoroughly.
            </p>
            <h4>Who We Interviewed:</h4>
            <p>
                Everyone in our group interviewed 2 people each.
                Stian interviewed two people living at Bakklandet at the age of 22 and 30. The younger test person is studying computer science at the university.
                Morten interviewd one student studying design and one 60 year old person living in Oslo.
                Ophelia interviewd one 23 years old student studding dance and a 28 years old friend living at Singsaker.
                Kari Anne interviewd her mother at 56 and her room-mate studying architecture.   
            </p>

            </p>

            <h3>Self-reflection</h3>
            <p>
                    We have learned more about HTML, CSS and JS, and how it is working with these technologies in a team. The last part is very relevant for future work. 
                    We also used Git to deal with version control and merging our code which was great once we got to know it.
