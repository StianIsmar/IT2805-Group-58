                    Due to the large age difference of the clientele, the website should be easy and intuitive also for users with little technology experience. The appearance of the website should reflect the warm and welcoming environment that Antikvariatet provides. The
                    webside should be effective, and all functionalities should react within a second.

                    The customers should easily be provided a menu for the café. They should also able to make and send in orders for the different events. The website should provide a calendar for all the events. One should be able to click on a date and see happenings
                    on that day, and also all happenings over a longer periode. For better usability, the customer should be able to divide the different events in smaller groups; concerts, social events or cultural activities and be able to search for
                    events. The customer should also be able to press a button and get the website in English instead of Norwegian.
