            <p>
                Antikvariatet is a cozy bar/pub/café/venue located at Bakklandet in Trondheim. It offers a great assortment of beers as well as outside serving. The inside of Antikvariatet consists of two separated areas. One offers a calm, laid-back atmosphere while
                the other hosts various kinds of events. The events ranges from small concerts and standup comedy to cultural performances and social debates.

            <h3>Purpose, goals and audience</h3>
            <p>
                The main purpose of this website is to inform customers about events happening at Antikvariatet. The business goal is to increase the amount of visitors to the venue. This means that the "event" section of the website needs to stand out. In addition,
                special offers also need to be clearly communicated. The website has to capture the cozy atmosphere Antikvariatet offers. In the section "Page layout and Apperatance" we will talk about how we want to acheive this.
                <br>
                <br> The intended user is in the age group 18 to 60. These customers tend to use the internet more for looking up information about the venue. In order for the website to caputre the attention to all age groups, it will have some content
                directed to both ends of the age scale. For example, artists directed towards younger and older clientelle will be booked. An example of an artist for older custormers would be the Norewgian band DDE.
